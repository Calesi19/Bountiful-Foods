We are a small business specializing in organic, locally grown foods, physically located in Carlsbad, California. We sell fruits and produce directly from the farmers in the area, but also use some national and international suppliers. Our owner-operated company caters to walk in traffic at their storefront in Carlsbad and, of course, our food trucks. We deliver and manage orders on the phone and via the website. The mission is to provide fresh and healthy food options, including organic, made to order, fruit drinks and fruit bags, to the local population and to tourists visiting the coastal areas. We operate many food trucks that cover the coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego. We offer fruit bowls, juice, and smoothies through our trucks.
